=head1 NAME

cmpClient - genCMPClient CLI for the Certificate Management Protocol (RFC4210)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<cmpClient> (B<imprint|bootstrap|update|revoke|pkcs10>) [B<-section> I<server>]

In this simple style of invocation, the first argument of the application,
e.g., C<bootstrap>, is mapped to using a section in F<config/demo.cnf>.
The optional server argument may be used to reference a CMP server to be used,
where the default is C<EJBCA>. This is also used as config section name.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<cmpClient> command is a demo and test client implementation
of the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) as defined in RFC 4210.
It can be used to request certificates from a CA via a CMP server,
to update or revoke them, and to perform possibly other CMP requests.

=head1 USAGE

=over 4

=item B<imprint|bootstrap|pkcs10|update|revoke>

Select demo C<use_case> of the cmpClient application. The corresponding CMP request
will be executed with default settings. These settings could be adapt via the
file 'config/demo.cnf'.

=item List of options available for the C<cmpClient> application:

=back


=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Display a summary of all options

=item B<-config> I<filename>

Configuration file to use.
An empty string C<""> means none.
Default filename is C<config/demo.cnf>.

=item B<-section> I<names>

Section(s) to use within config file defining CMP options.
An empty string C<""> means no specific section.
Default is C<default>.
Multiple section names may be given, separated by commas and/or whitespace.
Contents of sections named later may override contents of sections named before.
In any case, as usual, the C<[default]> section and finally the unnamed
section (as far as present) can provide per-option fallback values.

=item B<-verbosity> I<level>

Level of verbosity for logging, error output, etc.
0 = EMERG, 1 = ALERT, 2 = CRIT, 3 = ERR, 4 = WARN, 5 = NOTE,
6 = INFO, 7 = DEBUG, 8 = TRACE.
Defaults to 6 = INFO.
The levels DEBUG and TRACE are most useful for certificate status check issues.

=back


=head2 Message transfer options

=over 4

=item B<-server> I<[http[s]://]address[:port][/path]>

The IP address or DNS hostname and optionally port
of the CMP server to connect to using HTTP(S) transport.
The port defaults to 80 or 443 if the scheme is C<https>.
If a path is included it provides the default value for the B<-path> option.

=item B<-proxy> I<[http[s]://]address[:port][/path]>

The HTTP(S) proxy server to use for reaching the CMP server unless B<-no_proxy>
applies, see below.
The proxy port defaults to 80 or 443 if the scheme is C<https>; apart from that
the optional C<http://> or C<https://>prefix and any trailing path are ignored.
Defaults to the environment variable C<http_proxy> if set, else C<HTTP_PROXY>
in case no TLS is used, otherwise C<https_proxy> if set, else C<HTTPS_PROXY>.

=item B<-no_proxy> I<addresses>
List of IP addresses and/or DNS names of servers
not to use an HTTP(S) proxy for, separated by commas and/or whitespace
(where in the latter case the whole argument must be enclosed in "...").
Default is from the environment variable C<no_proxy> if set, else C<NO_PROXY>.

=item B<-path> I<remote_path>

HTTP path at the CMP server (aka CMP alias) to use for POST requests.
Defaults to any path given with B<-server>, else C<"/">.

=item B<-msg_timeout> I<seconds>

Number of seconds (or 0 for infinite) a CMP message round trip is
allowed to take before a timeout error is returned.
Default is 120.

=item B<-total_timeout> I<seconds>

Maximum number seconds an enrollment may take, including attempts polling for
certificates on C<waiting> PKIStatus.
Default is 0 (infinite).

=back


=head2 Server authentication options

=over 4

=item B<-trusted> I<filenames>

When verifying signature-based protection of CMP response messages,
these are the CA certificate(s) to trust while checking certificate chains
during CMP server authentication.
This option gives more flexibility than the B<-srvcert> option because the
protection certificate is not pinned but may be any certificate
for which a chain to one of the given trusted certificates can be constructed.

Multiple filenames may be given, separated by commas and/or whitespace
(where in the latter case the whole argument must be enclosed in "...").
Each source may contain multiple certificates.

=item B<-untrusted> I<sources>

Non-trusted intermediate certificate(s).
Any extra certificates given with the B<-cert> option are appended to it.
All these certificates may be useful for cert path construction
for the CMP client certificate (to include in the extraCerts field of outgoing
messages) and for the TLS client certificate (if TLS is enabled)
as well as for chain building when verifying
the CMP server certificate (checking signature-based CMP message protection),
when verifying stapled OCSP responses (while establishing TLS connections), and
when verifying the newly enrolled certificate.

Multiple filenames or URLs may be given, separated by commas and/or whitespace
(where in the latter case the whole argument must be enclosed in "...").
Each file may contain multiple certificates.

=item B<-srvcert> I<filename>

The specific CMP server certificate to expect and directly trust (even if it is
expired) when verifying signature-based protection of CMP response messages.
May be set alternatively to the B<-trusted> option to pin the accepted server.

If set, the subject of the certificate is also used
as default value for the recipient of CMP requests
and as default value for the expected sender of CMP responses.

=item B<-recipient> I<name>

Distinguished Name (DN) to use in the recipient field of CMP request messages,
i.e., the CMP server (usually the addressed CA).

The recipient field in the header of a CMP message is mandatory.
If not given explicitly the recipient is determined in the following order:
the subject of the CMP server certificate given with the B<-srvcert> option,
the B<-issuer> option,
the issuer of the certificate given with the B<-oldcert> option,
the issuer of the CMP client certificate (B<-cert> option),
the subject of the first certificate given with the B<-untrusted> option,
as far as any of those is present, else the NULL-DN as last resort.

The argument must be formatted as I</type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...>.
Characters may be escaped by C<\>E<nbsp>(backslash); whitespace is retained.
Empty values are permitted, but the corresponding type will not be included.
Giving a single C</> will lead to an empty sequence of RDNs (a NULL-DN).
Multi-valued RDNs can be formed by placing a C<+> character instead of a C</>
between the AttributeValueAssertions (AVAs) that specify the members of the set.
Example:

C</DC=org/DC=OpenSSL/DC=users/UID=123456+CN=John Doe>

=item B<-expect_sender> I<name>

Distinguished Name (DN) expected in the sender field of response messages.
Defaults to the subject DN of the pinned B<-srvcert>, if any.

This can be used to make sure that only a particular entity is accepted as
CMP message signer, and attackers are not able to use arbitrary certificates
of a trusted PKI hieararchy to fraudulently pose as CMP server.
Note that this option gives slightly more freedom than setting the B<-srvcert>,
which pins the server to the holder of a particular certificate, while the
expected sender name will continue to match after updates of the server cert.

The argument must be formatted as I</type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...>.
For details see the description of the B<-recipient> option.

=item B<-ignore_keyusage>

Ignore key usage restrictions in CMP signer certificates when verifying
signature-based protection of incoming CMP messages,
else C<digitalSignature> must be allowed for signer certificate.

=item B<-unprotected_errors>

Accept missing or invalid protection of negative responses from the server.
This applies to the following message types and contents:

=over 4

=item * error messages

=item * negative certificate responses (IP/CP/KUP)

=item * negative revocation responses (RP)

=item * negative PKIConf messages

=back

B<WARNING:> This setting leads to unspecified behavior and it is meant
exclusively to allow interoperability with server implementations violating
RFC 4210, e.g.:

=over 4

=item * section 5.1.3.1 allows exceptions from protecting only for special
cases:
"There MAY be cases in which the PKIProtection BIT STRING is deliberately not
used to protect a message [...] because other protection, external to PKIX, will
be applied instead."

=item * section 5.3.21 is clear on ErrMsgContent: "The CA MUST always sign it
with a signature key."

=item * appendix D.4 shows PKIConf having protection

=back

=item B<-extracertsout> I<filename>

The file where to save any extra certificates received in the extraCerts field
of response messages.

=item B<-cacertsout> I<filename>

The file where to save any CA certificates received in the caPubs field of
initializiation response (ip) messages.

=back


=head2 Client authentication options

=over 4

=item B<-ref> I<value>

Reference number/string/value to use as fallback senderKID; this is required
if no sender name can be determined from the B<-cert> or <-subject> options and
is typically used when authenticating with pre-shared key (password-based MAC).

=item B<-secret> I<arg>

Prefer PBM-based message protection with given source of a secret value.
The secret is used for creating PBM-based protection of outgoing messages
and (as far as needed) for verifying PBM-based protection of incoming messages.
PBM stands for Password-Based Message Authentication Code.
This takes precedence over the B<-cert> and B<-key> options.

Currently only plain passwords are supported,
which should be preceded by "pass:".

=item B<-cert> I<filename>

The client's current CMP signer certificate.
Requires for the corresponding key to be given with B<-key>.
The subject of this certificate will be used as sender of outgoing CMP messages,
while the subject of B<-oldcert> or B<-subjectName> may provide fallback values.
The issuer of this certificate is used as one of the recipient fallback values
and as fallback issuer entry in the cerificate template of IR, CR, and KUR.
When using signature-based message protection, this "protection certificate"
will be included first in the extraCerts field of outgoing messages
and the signature is done with the corresponding key.
In Initialization Request (IR) messages this can be used for authenticating
using an external entity certificate as defined in appendix E.7 of RFC 4210.
For Key Update Request (KUR) messages this is also used as
the certificate to be updated if the B<-oldcert> option is not given.
If the file includes further certs, they are appended to the untrusted certs
because they typically constitute the chain of the client certificate, which
is included in the extraCerts field in signature-protected request messages.

=item B<-own_trusted> I<filenames>

If this list of certificates are provided they are used as trust anchors
to verify the chain building for the own CMP signer certificate.

Multiple filenames may be given, separated by commas and/or whitespace
(where in the latter case the whole argument must be enclosed in "...").
Each source may contain multiple certificates.

=item B<-key> I<filename>

The corresponding private key file for the client's current certificate given in
the B<-cert> option.
This will be used for signature-based message protection
unless the B<-secret> option indicating PBM or B<-unprotected_requests> is given.

=item B<-keypass> I<arg>

Pass phrase source for the private key given with the B<-key> option.
Also used for B<-cert> and B<-oldcert> in case it is an encrypted PKCS#12 file.
If not given here, the password will be prompted for if needed.

Currently only plain passwords are supported,
which should be preceded by "pass:".

=item B<-digest> I<name>

Specifies name of supported digest to use in RFC 4210's MSG_SIG_ALG
and as the one-way function (OWF) in MSG_MAC_ALG.
If applicable, this is used for message protection and
Proof-of-Possession (POPO) signatures.
To see the list of supported digests, use B<openssl list -digest-commands>.
Defaults to C<sha256>.

=item B<-mac> I<name>

Specifies name of supported digest to use as the MAC algorithm in MSG_MAC_ALG.
To get the names of supported MAC algorithms use B<openssl list -mac-algorithms>
and possibly combine such a name with the name of a supported digest algorithm,
e.g., hmacWithSHA256.
Defaults to C<hmac-sha1> as per RFC 4210.

=item B<-extracerts> I<sources>

Certificates to append in the extraCerts field when sending messages.
They can be used as the default CMP signer certificate chain to include.

Multiple filenames or URLs may be given, separated by commas and/or whitespace
(where in the latter case the whole argument must be enclosed in "...").
Each source may contain multiple certificates.

=item B<-unprotected_requests>

Send messages without CMP-level protection.

template.
For KUR, it defaults to the public key
in the PKCS#10 CSR given with the B<-csr> option, if provided,
or of the reference certificate (see B<-oldcert>) if provided.
This default is used for IR and CR only if no SANs are set.
If the NULL-DN (C</>) is given then no subject is placed in the template.

=over 4

=item B<-oldcert> I<filename>

The certificate to be updated (i.e., renewed or re-keyed) in Key Update Request
(KUR) messages or to be revoked in Revocation Request (RR) messages.
For KUR the certificate to be updated defaults to B<-cert>,
and the resulting certificate is called I<reference certificate>.

The reference certificate, if any, is also used for

Multiple filenames may be given, separated by commas and/or whitespace.
As many files are read as needed for the complete transaction.

=item B<-rspout> I<filenames>

Save sequence of CMP responses to file(s).
Multiple filenames may be given, separated by commas and/or whitespace.
As many files are written as needed to store the complete transaction.

=head2 Certificate status checking options, for both CMP and TLS

The following set of options determine various parameters of
certificate revocation status checking to be performed by the client
on setting up any TLS connection and on checking any signature-based protection
of CMP messages received, but not when verifying newly enrolled certificates.

By default no certificate status checks are performed.
Status checking is demanded if any of the below status checking options are set,
but only as far as a trust store is provided for TLS or at CMP level.
Then by default only the leaf certificates of a chain are checked, i.e.,
the certificates of CMP servers and of TLS servers (as far as TLS is used).
The options B<-check_all> and B<-check_any> may be used to change the extent
of the checks to futher elements in the CA chain of these certificates.

For each certificate for which the status check is demanded the
certification verification procedure will try to obtain the revocation status
first via OCSP stapling if enabled,
then from any locally available CRLs,
then from any Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responders if enabled,
and finally from CRLs downloaded from certificate distribution points (CDPs)
if enabled.
With the B<-ocsp_last> option CDPs are tried before trying OCSP.
Verification fails if no valid and current revocation status can be found
or the status indicates that the certificate has been revoked.

=over 4

=item B<-check_all>

Check certificate status not only for leaf certificates of a chain
but for all certificates (except root, i.e., self-issued certificates).

=item B<-check_any>

Check certificate status for those certificates (except root certificates)
that contain a CDP or AIA entry (or for which OCSP stapling for TLS is enabled).
This option is overridden by B<-check_all> if set.

=item B<-crls> I<URLs>

Enable CRL-based status checking and
use given CRL(s) as primary source of certificate revocation information.
The URLs argument may contain a single element or
a comma- or whitespace-separated list,
each element starting with C<http:> or C<file:> or being a filename or pathname.

=item B<-use_cdp>

Enable CRL-based status checking and
enable using CRL Distribution Points (CDP) extension entries in certificates.

=item B<-cdps> I<URLs>

Enable CRL-based status checking and
use the given URL(s) as fallback certificate distribution points (CDP).

=item B<-crls_timeout> I<seconds>

Number of seconds fetching a CRL may take, or 0 for infinite.
A negative value implies the default: 10 seconds.

=item B<-use_aia>

Enable OCSP-based status checking and
enable using Authority Information Access (AIA) OCSP responder entries
in certificates.

=item B<-ocsp> I<URLs>

Enable OCSP-based status checking and
use given OCSP responder URL(s) as fallback.

=item B<-ocsp_timeout> I<seconds>

Number of seconds getting an OCSP response may take, or 0 for infinite.
A negative value implies the default: 10 seconds.

=item B<-ocsp_last>

This option can be used only when OCSP-based checks are enabled using B<-ocsp>
or B<-use_aia>. If checks downloading CRLs from CDPs are also enabled
then do OCSP-based checks last (else before using CRLs downloaded from CDPs).

=item B<-stapling>

Enable the TLS certificate status request extension ("OCSP stapling"),
which is tried first before any other methods of certificate status checking.
This makes sense only if B<-tls_used> is given.
So far OCSP multi-stapling is not supported,
so status information can be obtained in this way only for the leaf certificate
(i.e., the TLS server certificate).
